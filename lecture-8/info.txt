<h3 id="title">Block Doors Must Remain Closed – For Everyone’s Safety</h3>

We would like to remind you of an important safety rule on our campus.
 The main entrance doors are open during the day, but block doors must 
 always remain closed and preferably locked. These doors are fire doors 
 and play a crucial role in both fire protection and overall security.
